# Fixed: Azure 404 "Resource not found" Error

## üîç What Was Wrong

The Azure endpoint was returning **404 "Resource not found"** because:
- The endpoint URL might have had trailing slashes
- Or the endpoint URL included `/formrecognizer` (causing duplicate paths)
- The full URL was malformed: `https://endpoint.com//formrecognizer/documentModels/...`

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

1. **URL cleaning**: Now removes trailing slashes and duplicate `/formrecognizer` paths
2. **Better logging**: Shows the cleaned endpoint and full URL in logs
3. **New diagnostic endpoints**:
   - `/api/v1/ocr/health` - Shows configuration and cleaned URLs
   - `/api/v1/ocr/test-azure-connection` - Tests Azure credentials without uploading

## üöÄ Test After Deploy (2-3 minutes)

### Step 1: Check Health
```bash
curl https://pocket-pallet.onrender.com/api/v1/ocr/health
```

Look for:
```json
{
  "endpoint_cleaned": "https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com",
  "full_url_sample": "https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/formrecognizer/documentModels/prebuilt-layout:analyze?api-version=2024-07-31"
}
```

‚úÖ The `full_url_sample` should look like this format  
‚ùå If you see double slashes `//` or duplicate `/formrecognizer/formrecognizer/`, your endpoint is still wrong

### Step 2: Test Azure Connection
```bash
curl https://pocket-pallet.onrender.com/api/v1/ocr/test-azure-connection
```

Expected success:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Azure connection successful",
  "endpoint": "https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com",
  "api_version": "2024-07-31",
  "models_available": 15
}
```

If you get `"ok": false`:
- **401 error**: Your API key is wrong
- **404 error**: Your endpoint URL is still malformed
- **Connection error**: Network issue or wrong domain

### Step 3: Try Wine List Upload
1. Go to https://pocket-pallet.vercel.app/ocr
2. Upload a wine list PDF or image
3. Should now work! üéâ

## üîç If Still Getting 404

### Check Your Azure Endpoint Format

Your `AZURE_DOC_INTEL_ENDPOINT` should look like:
```
https://your-resource-name.cognitiveservices.azure.com
```

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå `https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/formrecognizer` (has extra path)
- ‚ùå `https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/` (has trailing slash)
- ‚ùå `your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com` (missing `https://`)
- ‚úÖ `https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com` (correct!)

### How to Fix on Render

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your backend service
3. Click "Environment"
4. Find `AZURE_DOC_INTEL_ENDPOINT`
5. Click "Edit"
6. Make sure it's exactly: `https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.cognitiveservices.azure.com`
   - No trailing `/`
   - No `/formrecognizer` at the end
   - Must start with `https://`
7. Click "Save Changes"
8. Wait 2-3 minutes for redeploy

### Check Render Logs

Go to Render ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Logs

Look for these log lines when you upload:
```
OCR request received for file: your-file.pdf
Cleaned endpoint: https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
Full URL: https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/formrecognizer/documentModels/prebuilt-layout:analyze?api-version=2024-07-31
Model: prebuilt-layout
API Version: 2024-07-31
Submitting to Azure: https://...
Azure response status: 202
```

‚úÖ If you see status `202` or `200` ‚Üí Success!  
‚ùå If you see status `404` ‚Üí Endpoint URL is still wrong

## üîß Advanced Troubleshooting

### Try Different API Versions

If 404 persists, your Azure resource might use an older API version. Try:

Add this to Render environment variables:
- Key: `AZURE_DOC_INTEL_API_VERSION`  
- Value: `2023-07-31` (or `2024-02-29-preview`)

Then update the code to use it (or I can help with this).

### Check Azure Region

Make sure your Azure resource is in a supported region:
- East US
- West US 2
- West Europe
- etc.

Some regions have limited API versions.

### Verify Resource Type

In Azure Portal, confirm your resource is:
- **Type**: "Document Intelligence" (or "Form Recognizer")
- **Not**: "Computer Vision" or "Cognitive Services Multi-Service"

## üìû Next Steps

After the deploy completes (2-3 minutes):

1. ‚úÖ Test health endpoint
2. ‚úÖ Test Azure connection endpoint
3. ‚úÖ Try uploading a wine list
4. ‚ùå Still 404? Check your endpoint format in Render
5. ‚ùå Still issues? Share the Render logs

The logs will now show exactly what URL is being called, making it much easier to debug!
