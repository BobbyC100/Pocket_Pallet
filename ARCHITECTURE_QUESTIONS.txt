BANYAN ARCHITECTURE: 5 KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED
================================================

Written in Plain Language for Founders & Non-Technical Stakeholders


QUESTION 1: Who Controls Access When We Have Multiple Companies?
================================================================

THE SITUATION TODAY:
-------------------
Right now, Banyan uses Clerk to handle logins (email, Google, anonymous users). 
But there's no system to control WHO can see WHAT documents.

Everyone who creates a document owns it, but there's no:
- Shared team workspaces
- Different permission levels (view-only vs editor)
- Organization boundaries

WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD:
---------------------
Think of it like Google Docs permissions, but for your company:

1. ORGANIZATIONS
   - Each company is an "organization"
   - Documents belong to an organization, not just one person
   - Example: "Acme Construction Co" is an org with 5 team members

2. ROLES & PERMISSIONS
   - Owner: Can do everything, including delete the org
   - Admin: Can invite people, manage settings
   - Editor: Can create and edit documents
   - Viewer: Can only read documents

3. SHARING
   - Share a document with specific people outside your org
   - Set expiration dates on shares (like "view for 30 days")
   - Track who viewed what and when

WHO'S IN CHARGE:
---------------
- Clerk handles logins (who you are)
- We build custom permission system (what you can access)
- Database enforces rules automatically (safety net)

ANALOGY: Clerk is like your building's front desk (checks ID). Our permission 
system is like the key cards that let you into certain floors and rooms.


QUESTION 2: How Do We Handle Errors & Track Problems?
=====================================================

THE SITUATION TODAY:
-------------------
When something breaks, we just log "Error: failed" to the console. This makes 
debugging really hard because:
- No context about what went wrong
- No way to track patterns (is this happening to everyone?)
- Generic error messages confuse users
- No alerts when critical things break

WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD:
---------------------

1. CLEAR ERROR TYPES
   Instead of "Error: failed", we'd have:
   - "AI Generation Failed: OpenAI timeout after 30 seconds"
   - "Document Not Found: User tried to access document they don't own"
   - "Validation Error: Vision statement must be under 500 characters"

2. ERROR TRACKING SERVICE (Sentry)
   Think of it as a "mission control dashboard" for errors:
   - Emails you when new errors appear
   - Groups similar errors together (shows if 50 users hit same bug)
   - Shows you the user's journey before the error
   - Tracks if errors are increasing or decreasing

3. STRUCTURED LOGGING
   Every important action writes a proper log entry:
   - What happened: "User generated vision framework"
   - Who did it: User ID or anonymous ID
   - How long it took: 35 seconds
   - Success or failure
   
   This makes it easy to answer questions like:
   - "Why did Bobby's generation fail yesterday at 3pm?"
   - "How many people are hitting AI timeouts?"
   - "What's our average generation time?"

4. USER-FRIENDLY ERROR MESSAGES
   Users see helpful messages, not technical jargon:
   
   BAD:  "Error: undefined response from chat.completions.create"
   GOOD: "AI generation timed out. This usually means high demand. 
          Please try again in a few minutes."

REAL EXAMPLE:
------------
If OpenAI's API goes down:
- We catch the error immediately
- Sentry alerts you via email/Slack
- Users see: "Our AI partner is experiencing issues. We're monitoring it."
- Dashboard shows how many users were affected
- When it's fixed, you can see recovery time


QUESTION 3: How Do We Test AI-Generated Content?
================================================

THE SITUATION TODAY:
-------------------
We have a bash script that tests scoring, but no automated tests for:
- Actual AI generation
- Quality of outputs
- Regression (making sure new code doesn't break old features)

THE CHALLENGE:
-------------
Testing AI is hard because:
- Outputs vary (same input = slightly different output each time)
- Real API calls cost money ($0.10 per test = expensive!)
- Tests take 30+ seconds to run (too slow for development)

WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD:
---------------------

1. GOLDEN FIXTURES (The "Before" Photos)
   Save examples of really good outputs as reference files.
   
   Example: Save a high-quality vision framework as "golden_framework_v1.json"
   
   In tests, we check:
   - Does new output have all the required fields?
   - Does it score at least 7.5/10 like the golden version?
   - Is the structure still correct?
   
   ANALOGY: Like keeping "before" photos when renovating. You compare new 
   work against the original to make sure you didn't lose anything good.

2. MOCKED AI RESPONSES (Fake It Until You Make It)
   For 95% of tests, we don't call the real AI. We pretend.
   
   Instead of waiting 30 seconds and paying $0.10, we instantly return a 
   pre-written response. Tests run in 0.5 seconds and cost nothing.
   
   We only call the REAL AI:
   - Once a day (nightly test to verify API still works)
   - When someone manually requests it
   - Before deploying to production

3. CONTRACT TESTS (Making Sure the Rules Still Apply)
   Check that AI responses still follow our format rules:
   - Is "vision" a string?
   - Is "strategy" an array of 2-5 items?
   - Does each bet have an owner and measure?
   
   If OpenAI changes their API, these tests catch it immediately.

4. VISUAL REGRESSION TESTS (Screenshot Comparisons)
   Take screenshots of quality badges, compare to previous screenshots.
   
   If a code change accidentally breaks the visual design, we know before 
   users see it.

COST BREAKDOWN:
--------------
- Mock tests (95%): $0 per run, instant
- Real API tests (5%): $5-10 per day in API costs
- Visual tests: $0, runs on CI/CD

This is way cheaper than the current "manual testing in production" approach.


QUESTION 4: Where Does Analytics Data Go?
=========================================

THE SITUATION TODAY:
-------------------
We have database tables for tracking events (lensEvents, eventsAudit) but:
- Barely used
- No dashboard to view the data
- No way to answer business questions like:
  * How many people finish the wizard?
  * Which sections get refined most?
  * What's our conversion rate from anonymous to signed-up?

WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD:
---------------------

TWO-TRACK SYSTEM:

1. INTERNAL DATABASE (For Product Features)
   Store basic analytics in Postgres for:
   - Showing users their own stats ("You've created 5 frameworks")
   - Real-time dashboards in the app
   - Features like "Recently viewed documents"
   
   Think: Operational data that powers the product itself.

2. EXTERNAL SERVICE - PostHog (For Business Intelligence)
   Send all events to PostHog for:
   - Funnel analysis (where do users drop off?)
   - Cohort analysis (do users from Google convert better than organic?)
   - Session replay (watch recordings of user sessions to spot UX issues)
   - Feature flags (show new features to 10% of users first)
   
   Think: Business intelligence and product improvement.

WHAT EVENTS TO TRACK:
--------------------
Every important user action:
- wizard_step_completed
- brief_generated
- framework_generated
- section_refined
- document_saved
- document_shared
- user_signed_up
- export_pdf

Each event includes:
- Who did it (user ID or anonymous ID)
- When (timestamp)
- Context (what was the quality score? how long did it take?)

EXAMPLE QUESTIONS WE CAN ANSWER:
--------------------------------
Week 1: "95 people started the wizard, 67 finished. 28 dropped off."
Week 2: "Of the 67 who finished, 42 refined at least one section."
Week 3: "Average quality score improved from 6.8 to 7.4 after refinements."

WHY POSTHOG?
-----------
- Free up to 1 million events per month (plenty for early stage)
- Can self-host if we need data privacy later
- All-in-one: analytics + session replay + feature flags
- No code changes needed to add new events

COSTS:
------
- Free tier: 1M events/month
- Paid tier: ~$200/month at 5M events
- Database storage: Minimal (we only keep last 90 days)


QUESTION 5: When Do We Need to Break Up the App?
================================================

THE SITUATION TODAY:
-------------------
Everything lives in one Next.js app on Vercel:
- Web pages
- API routes
- AI generation
- Database queries

This is PERFECT for where we are now. But there are predictable breaking 
points as we grow.

BREAKING POINT 1: 100+ People Using It At Once
==============================================
PROBLEM: 
AI generation takes 30-40 seconds. Vercel has a 60-second timeout on free 
tier (300 seconds on paid). If we get popular, we'll hit timeouts.

SOLUTION: Worker Queue System
Instead of generating in real-time:

1. User clicks "Generate"
2. We instantly return: "Your framework is being generated (Job #12345)"
3. Heavy work happens in the background (no timeout)
4. We notify user when done (email or real-time update)

ANALOGY: Like Apple Store's "We'll text you when your phone is ready" instead 
of making you wait at the counter.

TOOLS:
- Inngest (easiest, serverless workers)
- BullMQ (more control, requires Redis server)

COST: ~$50-100/month for worker infrastructure

WHEN: When we hit 100+ daily active users doing heavy AI operations


BREAKING POINT 2: 1,000+ Daily Users
====================================
PROBLEM:
Database connections max out. Queries slow down. Users see "Loading..." 
for too long.

SOLUTION: Database Optimization
1. Connection Pooling (reuse database connections, don't create new ones)
2. Read Replicas (separate database for read-heavy queries)
3. Caching (Redis for frequently-accessed data)

EXAMPLE:
Instead of hitting database for every "Get my documents" request, we:
- Cache the list in Redis for 5 minutes
- Update cache when user creates/edits document
- Database load drops by 70%

COST: 
- Redis: $10-50/month
- Read replica: $50-150/month

WHEN: When database CPU consistently above 70% or queries taking >500ms


BREAKING POINT 3: $10,000/Month in AI Costs
===========================================
PROBLEM:
OpenAI charges $0.03-0.10 per generation. At scale:
- 100 generations/day = $300/month ✓ Affordable
- 1,000 generations/day = $3,000/month ⚠️ Getting expensive
- 5,000 generations/day = $15,000/month ❌ Not sustainable

SOLUTION: Hybrid AI Strategy

Keep OpenAI for:
- Initial high-quality generation (worth the cost)
- Complex reasoning tasks

Add Self-Hosted AI for:
- Refinements (cheaper, faster)
- Bulk operations
- Non-critical tasks

NUMBERS:
- OpenAI GPT-4: $0.10 per generation
- Self-hosted Llama 3.1: $0.01 per generation (after setup)
- Savings: 90% on refinement operations

EXAMPLE MONTHLY COSTS:
1,000 users × 2 generations each = 2,000 operations
- All OpenAI: $200/month
- Hybrid (50/50): $110/month
- Mostly self-hosted: $60/month

WHEN: When AI costs exceed $1,000/month


BREAKING POINT 4: 10,000+ Organizations
=======================================
PROBLEM:
Single database can't handle that many tenants efficiently. Queries slow 
down even with optimization.

SOLUTION: Database Sharding
Split organizations across multiple databases based on ID:
- Orgs 0-2499 → Database 1
- Orgs 2500-4999 → Database 2
- Orgs 5000-7499 → Database 3
- Orgs 7500-10000 → Database 4

OR: Move to auto-scaling database (CockroachDB, PlanetScale)

COST: $500-2000/month for managed sharding

WHEN: When we hit 5,000+ organizations (likely 2+ years away)


THE TIMELINE (Rough Estimates)
==============================

TODAY (0-100 users):
- Keep everything as-is
- Current stack is perfect for this stage
- Focus on product, not infrastructure

3-6 MONTHS (100-500 users):
- Add worker queue for AI generation
- Implement proper error tracking (Sentry)
- Set up analytics (PostHog)
Cost: +$150/month

6-12 MONTHS (500-2,000 users):
- Add database connection pooling
- Consider read replicas
- Optimize slow queries
Cost: +$300/month

12-18 MONTHS (2,000-5,000 users):
- Add caching layer (Redis)
- Hybrid AI strategy (if costs justify it)
- Consider database sharding
Cost: +$800/month

18+ MONTHS (5,000+ users):
- Full microservices if needed
- Multiple database shards
- Dedicated AI infrastructure
Cost: +$2,000+/month

BUT REMEMBER: These are problems you WANT to have. They mean you're growing.


PRIORITY RANKING (What to Build First)
=======================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Do in Next 2-4 Weeks):
✓ Error handling system (Sentry)
✓ Basic permission middleware
✓ Analytics setup (PostHog)
EFFORT: 5-7 days total
COST: ~$50/month

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Do in Next 1-2 Months):
✓ Testing framework with golden fixtures
✓ Worker queue for AI generation (when timeouts start happening)
EFFORT: 8-10 days total
COST: ~$100/month

LOW PRIORITY (Do When Pain Points Appear):
✓ Database optimization (wait until you see slowness)
✓ Self-hosted AI (wait until costs justify it)
✓ Sharding (wait until you're enterprise-scale)


BOTTOM LINE
===========

Your current architecture is GREAT for where you are. The key is knowing:

1. What to build NOW (error handling, basic permissions)
2. What to build SOON (analytics, testing)
3. What to build LATER (scaling infrastructure)

Most startups over-engineer too early. You're in good shape - focus on 
getting users first, then scale when you need to.

The fact you're thinking about these questions now means you'll be ready 
when you hit the breaking points. But don't build for 10,000 users when 
you have 100. Build for 300 users, and you'll know when to scale up.
