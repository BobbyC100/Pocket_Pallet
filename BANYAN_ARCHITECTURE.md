**Plain-Language Overview for Founders & Stakeholders**

## üß≠ Executive Summary

- **Stable today:** Banyan's single-app stack on Vercel easily supports up to ~300 users.  
- **Next 90 days:** Focus on reliability (Sentry), visibility (PostHog), and basic organization permissions.  
- **Next 12 months:** Add background workers, automated testing, and analytics refinement.  
- **Longer term:** Scale only when metrics justify it ‚Äî DB pooling, caching, sharding.  
- **Principle:** Build for 300 users now; scale for 10,000 only when the data says so.

## üß© Five Key Questions

| # | Question | Current State | What's Next | Trigger Metric | Owner / Lead |
|---|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Access Control for Multiple Companies** | Clerk handles identity; docs owned by individuals | Add `organizations` + `memberships` + role-based access (Owner/Admin/Editor/Viewer) | >2 companies sharing docs | Eng / Ops |
| 2 | **Error Handling & Tracking** | Console logs only | `BanyanError` type + Sentry + structured logs | >5% 5xx errors/day | Eng |
| 3 | **Testing AI Content** | Manual bash script | Golden fixtures, mocked AI, nightly real runs | Two regressions/week | QA |
| 4 | **Analytics Data** | Some events in DB | Dual-write to PostHog + internal dashboards | Can't answer "where do users drop off?" | Product |
| 5 | **Breaking Up the App** | Monolith on Vercel | Add worker queue, pooling, caching as load grows | See timeline | Eng / Ops |

## üìä Decision Framework

### When to Invest in Each Layer

#### **Error Handling (Sentry)**
- **Do Now** if: Any production errors cause user data loss
- **Priority:** HIGH (foundational)
- **Effort:** 2 days
- **ROI:** Catch bugs before users report them

#### **Organization Permissions**
- **Do Now** if: 2+ teams want to share workspaces
- **Priority:** HIGH (enables B2B)
- **Effort:** 3-5 days
- **ROI:** Unlocks team plans, higher ARPU

#### **Analytics (PostHog)**
- **Do Now** if: Can't answer "where do users drop off?"
- **Priority:** HIGH (product decisions)
- **Effort:** 1 day
- **ROI:** Data-driven feature prioritization

#### **Worker Queue (Inngest)**
- **Wait until:** 100+ daily generations OR timeouts occur
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (performance)
- **Effort:** 3-4 days
- **ROI:** Eliminates timeouts, better UX

#### **Automated Testing**
- **Wait until:** 2+ regressions per week
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (velocity)
- **Effort:** 5-7 days
- **ROI:** Ship faster with confidence

#### **Database Scaling**
- **Wait until:** DB CPU >70% OR queries >500ms
- **Priority:** LOW (premature)
- **Effort:** 2-3 days per optimization
- **ROI:** Handles 10x more users

#### **Self-Hosted AI**
- **Wait until:** AI costs >$1,000/month
- **Priority:** LOW (cost optimization)
- **Effort:** 10-15 days
- **ROI:** 50-90% cost reduction on refinements

## ‚úÖ Decision Log

### Why This Stack?
- **Next.js**: Server components + API routes = one codebase
- **Drizzle**: Lightweight ORM, great TypeScript support
- **Clerk**: Anonymous ‚Üí authenticated flow is hard; they solved it
- **Postgres**: JSONB + full-text search + battle-tested
- **Vercel**: Zero-config deploys, excellent DX

### Why NOT This Stack?
- **GraphQL**: Overkill for CRUD operations
- **Microservices**: Premature for <1K users
- **NoSQL**: Need relational structure for permissions
- **Self-hosted**: Want to focus on product, not DevOps

### Key Architectural Principles
1. **Optimize for change** - Use JSONB for flexible documents
2. **Delay abstraction** - Monolith until pain points appear
3. **Instrument everything** - Can't optimize what you can't measure
4. **Plan for 3x growth** - Not 10x or 100x
5. **Buy before build** - Use Sentry/PostHog vs building dashboards
