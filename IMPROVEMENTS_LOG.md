# Banyan Improvements Log

## Session: October 5, 2025

### ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

#### 1. Request ID Tracking
**File**: `src/middleware.ts`

**What it does:**
- Generates unique ID for every request (UUID)
- Adds `X-Request-ID` header to all responses
- Logs request start/end with ID and duration
- Makes debugging 10x easier

**Usage:**
```bash
# In logs, you'll now see:
[abc-123-def] POST /api/generate-brief
[abc-123-def] Completed in 23450ms
```

**User benefit:** When someone reports "my generation failed," they can give you the Request ID from their browser's Network tab, and you can trace it instantly.

---

#### 2. Rate Limiting
**File**: `src/lib/rate-limiter.ts`

**What it does:**
- Prevents abuse (anonymous users spamming AI generation)
- Different limits for different endpoints:
  - AI Generation: 10/hour
  - AI Refinement: 30/hour
  - Document Save: 100/hour
  - General API: 100/minute
- In-memory (upgradeable to Redis later)
- Can disable in development with `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT=true`

**Applied to:**
- `/api/generate-brief` route

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { checkRateLimit, RATE_LIMITS } from '@/lib/rate-limiter';

const rateLimit = checkRateLimit(userId || anonymousId, RATE_LIMITS.AI_GENERATION);
if (!rateLimit.allowed) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Rate limit exceeded', retryAfter: rateLimit.retryAfter },
    { status: 429 }
  );
}
```

**User benefit:** Prevents surprise $1000 OpenAI bills from abuse or bugs.

---

#### 3. Environment Variables Template
**File**: `env.example`

**What it does:**
- Documents all required and optional environment variables
- Shows where to get API keys
- Has sensible defaults for development
- Makes onboarding new developers 10x faster

**Usage:**
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
# Then fill in your actual keys
```

**User benefit:** New team members can get set up in 5 minutes instead of 30.

---

#### 4. Health Check Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/health/route.ts`

**What it does:**
- Returns JSON with system health status
- Checks database connectivity
- Checks OpenAI API key exists
- Shows uptime, version, environment
- Returns 200 for OK, 503 for down

**Usage:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Returns:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T14:30:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "environment": "development",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "openai": "ok"
  }
}
```

**User benefit:** 
- Can set up Uptime Robot to monitor this endpoint
- Deployment validation (check health after deploy)
- Quick debugging ("Is it down for everyone or just me?")

---

#### 5. Cost Tracking
**File**: `src/lib/cost-tracker.ts`

**What it does:**
- Calculates exact cost of each AI operation
- Supports all models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini)
- Logs costs to console (extensible to database)
- Can compare costs between models
- Can find cheapest model for operation

**Applied to:**
- `/api/generate-brief` route (tracks every generation)

**Output Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "ai_cost",
  "operation": "generate-brief",
  "cost": {
    "total": "0.1234",
    "input": "0.0456",
    "output": "0.0778"
  },
  "tokens": {
    "input": 4560,
    "output": 2593,
    "total": 7153
  },
  "model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T14:30:00Z",
  "requestId": "abc-123",
  "userId": "user_xyz"
}
```

**User benefit:**
- Know exactly where money goes
- Identify high-cost users
- Optimize expensive operations
- Budget accurately

### üéØ What Changed in Code

#### Modified Files:
1. `src/middleware.ts` - Added request ID tracking
2. `src/app/api/generate-brief/route.ts` - Added rate limiting + cost tracking

#### New Files:
1. `src/lib/rate-limiter.ts` - Rate limiting utility
2. `src/lib/cost-tracker.ts` - Cost tracking utility
3. `src/app/api/health/route.ts` - Health check endpoint
4. `env.example` - Environment variables template

---

### üöÄ How to Test

#### 1. Test Request IDs
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Make a request and check response headers
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Should see:
# X-Request-ID: abc-123-def-456-...
```

#### 2. Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# In .env.local, make sure DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT is NOT set

# Make 11 requests quickly (limit is 10/hour)
for i in {1..11}; do
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/generate-brief \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"responses": {...}, "anonymousId": "test123"}'
done

# 11th request should return 429 Too Many Requests
```

#### 3. Test Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health | jq

# Should see status: "ok" and database: "ok"
```

#### 4. Test Cost Tracking
```bash
# Generate a brief
curl http://localhost:3000/api/generate-brief \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"responses": {...}}'

# Check server logs, should see:
# [abc-123] üí∞ Cost: $0.1234 (7153 tokens)
```

- [ ] Add streaming responses for generation progress (4 hours)
- [ ] Add same improvements to `/api/vision-framework-v2/generate` route
- [ ] Add same improvements to `/api/vision-framework-v2/refine` route

#### Medium Priority:
- [ ] Add Sentry error tracking
- [ ] Set up PostHog analytics

- [ ] Add prompt versioning

#### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add "Continue where you left off" banner
- [ ] Add quality comparison stats
- [ ] Create TROUBLESHOOTING.md

### üêõ Known Issues / Considerations

1. **Rate limiter is in-memory**: Resets on server restart. For production, consider Redis-backed solution (Upstash).

2. **Cost tracking only logs to console**: Need to add database storage for long-term analysis.

3. **Health check doesn't test actual OpenAI call**: Too expensive. Only checks if key exists.

4. **Request IDs in middleware**: Only works for routes that go through Next.js middleware. Direct API routes may need separate handling.

---

### üí° Usage Examples

#### For Debugging:
```bash
# User reports: "My generation failed"
# Ask for Request ID from browser Network tab
# Search logs: grep "abc-123" logs.txt
# See entire request lifecycle
```

#### For Cost Analysis:
```bash
# Extract cost logs
grep "ai_cost" logs.txt | jq '.cost.total' | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print "Total: $"sum}'

# Find most expensive users
grep "ai_cost" logs.txt | jq -r '[.userId, .cost.total] | @tsv' | sort -k2 -rn | head
```

#### For Monitoring:
```bash
# Set up cron job or monitoring service
curl -f http://yourapp.com/api/health || alert_team
```

### üìö Documentation Updated

- ‚úÖ Created `IMPROVEMENTS_LOG.md` (this file)
- ‚úÖ Updated `env.example` with all variables
- ‚è≥ Need to update `README.md` with new features
- ‚è≥ Need to create API documentation

---

### üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Request IDs are worth their weight in gold** - Should have added this from day 1

2. **Rate limiting is insurance** - Costs 30 minutes to build, prevents $1000+ disasters

3. **Developer experience matters** - env.example file makes onboarding painless

4. **Observability isn't optional** - Can't optimize what you can't measure

5. **Start simple, scale later** - In-memory rate limiter is fine for <500 users

---

### üôè Credit

These improvements were implemented following industry best practices:
- Request IDs: Standard pattern from Stripe, Twilio APIs
- Rate limiting: Based on Express-rate-limit approach
- Health checks: Following Google SRE practices
- Cost tracking: Inspired by AWS CloudWatch Insights
