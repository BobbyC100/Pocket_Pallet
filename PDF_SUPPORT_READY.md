## 🚀 How to Use

### For Your 20 Papers:

```bash
# 1. Drop PDFs into folder
cp ~/Downloads/*.pdf research-papers/to-ingest/

# 2. Optionally rename for better metadata

## 🎯 What Changed

### Code Changes:
✅ **Installed `pdf-parse`** - NPM package for PDF text extraction  
✅ **Updated `bulk-ingest-research.ts`** - Auto-detects PDFs and extracts text  
✅ **Updated all docs** - README, QUICK_START, INSTRUCTIONS  

### Features:
✅ **PDF support** - Just drop `.pdf` files  
✅ **Mixed formats** - `.pdf` and `.txt` work together  
✅ **Auto text extraction** - No manual conversion needed  
✅ **Same metadata extraction** - Works with filename or content

## 📁 File Format Support

| Format | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `.pdf` | ✅ Fully supported | Auto text extraction |
| `.txt` | ✅ Fully supported | Plain text |
| `.docx` | ⏳ Coming later | Need docx parser |
| `.md` | ⏳ Coming later | Markdown support |

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Good PDFs:
- ✅ Text-based PDFs (copy-pasteable)
- ✅ Well-formatted academic papers
- ✅ Clean text extraction

### Problematic PDFs:
- ❌ Scanned images (need OCR)
- ❌ Complex multi-column layouts
- ❌ Heavy formatting/tables

**If PDF extraction doesn't work well:**
- Manually copy-paste text to `.txt` file
- Or use https://pdftotext.com for cleaner extraction

## 🧪 Test It Now

Want to test with a sample PDF?

```bash
# Download a sample paper (if you have one handy)
cp ~/path/to/paper.pdf research-papers/to-ingest/TestPaper_2020_Sample.pdf

# Run ingestion
npm run ingest-research

# Check results
npm run rgrs-stats
```

---

## 📚 Example Workflow

**You have 20 PDFs on your desktop:**

```bash
# 1. Copy to ingestion folder
cp ~/Desktop/research/*.pdf research-papers/to-ingest/

# 2. Optional: Rename for better metadata
cd research-papers/to-ingest/
mv "paper1.pdf" "Grant_2021_TeamDynamics.pdf"
mv "paper2.pdf" "Cameron_2018_OrgChange.pdf"
# ... (or keep original names, script is smart!)

# 3. Run ingestion
cd ~/Banyan
npm run ingest-research

# 4. Wait ~10-20 minutes (shows progress)

# 5. Check what got ingested
npm run rgrs-stats

# 6. Test in app!
# Go to localhost:3001/new and generate a framework
# You should see citations from your 20 papers!
```

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### PDF Parser:
- **Library:** `pdf-parse` (Node.js)
- **Method:** Text extraction from PDF structure
- **Limitations:** Text-based PDFs only (not scanned images)
- **Performance:** ~2-5 seconds per PDF

### Fallback Strategy:
If PDF extraction fails or produces poor results, the script will show an error and you can:
1. Convert PDF to TXT manually
2. Or fix the PDF and retry

## 🎯 You're Ready!

**When you have your 20 PDFs:**

1. Drop them in `research-papers/to-ingest/`
2. Run `npm run ingest-research`
3. Wait for completion
4. Test in your app!

**No conversion needed. Just drop and run!** 🚀

## 📝 Commands Reference

```bash
# Ingest all papers in folder
npm run ingest-research

# Check what's in your corpus
npm run rgrs-stats

# Test retrieval
npm run rgrs-test
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to parse PDF"
- PDF might be image-based (needs OCR)
- Try converting to TXT manually
- Or use a different PDF source

### "File too short"
- PDF extraction produced < 100 chars
- Check if PDF is valid
- Try manual extraction

### "Already exists"
- Paper was previously ingested (deduplication working!)
- Files with same content hash are skipped

---

## 🎉 What's Next

**After your 20 papers are ingested:**

✅ Generate frameworks and see rich citations  
✅ Citations from multiple sources  
✅ Research-backed insights in every generation  

**Future enhancements:**
- 🌐 Web UI for drag-and-drop (Option 2 - on TODO list!)
- 📊 Corpus management dashboard
- 🔍 Search your research library
- 📈 Citation analytics
- 🎯 BAI v1 scoring with research grounding

**You're all set! Drop those PDFs and let's go! 🚀**
