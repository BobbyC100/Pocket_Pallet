# ðŸŒ³ Banyan â€” Quick Pitch

**Transform founder instinct into living strategic clarity**

---

## The Problem

Founders have their vision locked in their heads. When they try to share it:
- They explain it differently every time
- Documents go stale immediately
- Teams drift out of alignment
- Investors get confused

**Result:** Founders spend more time explaining than executing.

**Research shows this is measurably harmful:**
- Goal misalignment reduces engagement and performance (Dalain, 2023)
- Strategy-culture disconnect creates confusion and disengagement (Nishii et al., 2016)
- Organizations lack the translation layer from vision to behavior (Tosti & Jackson, 2000)

## The Big Bet

**Strategic clarity should be continuous, not episodic.**

Today: Founders write a strategy doc once (if at all), it goes stale, they repeat verbal pitches that drift.

Tomorrow: Founders use Banyan weekly to refine their thinking, keep teams aligned, and evolve strategy as they learn.

**Banyan becomes the source of truth for "What are we building and why?"**
