# Iterative Refinement & Auto-Quality Detection
## Product One-Pager

---

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**

Banyan's Iterative Refinement system enables founders to improve AI-generated Vision Framework content through intelligent, AI-powered feedback loops. Combined with Auto-Quality Detection, founders receive immediate quality assessments and guided improvement suggestions for each section of their framework.

---

## 💡 **The Problem**

**Before this feature:**
- Founders receive AI-generated Vision Framework content but have no way to improve it without manually rewriting
- No visibility into which sections are strong vs. weak
- No guidance on how to make content more specific, actionable, or aligned with their vision
- High friction to iterate: founders must exit Banyan, edit in Google Docs, then re-input changes

**Result:** Generic or misaligned content that founders don't feel ownership over.

---

## ✨ **The Solution**

### **1. Auto-Quality Detection**
Automatically scores each framework section on generation:
- **Specificity** (1-10): Generic vs. Concrete
- **Actionability** (1-10): Vague vs. Clear
- **Alignment** (1-10): Off-brand vs. On-brand
- **Measurability** (1-10): For bets/metrics only

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Excellent (8-10)**: Green badge with score
- 🟡 **Good (6-7.9)**: Yellow badge with score
- 🔴 **Needs Work (<6)**: Red badge + "👀 Needs Attention" flag

**Quality Details:**
- **Issues**: What needs improvement
- **Suggestions**: How to improve
- **Strengths**: What's working well

---

### **2. Iterative Refinement**
Founders can refine any section with one click or custom feedback:

#### **Quick Actions** (Pre-defined refinements)
| Action | What It Does | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **More Specific** | Replaces generic language with concrete details from your brief (markets, numbers, timelines) | Content feels too high-level or vague |
| **More Concise** | Shortens wordy content, removes fluff, makes it punchier | Content is too verbose or redundant |
| **Different Angle** | Reframes the same idea from a new perspective while keeping core meaning | Current framing doesn't resonate |
| **Add Detail** | Expands content with examples, context, and specifics | Content feels incomplete or surface-level |
| **Regenerate** | Complete rewrite from scratch using original brief data | Starting over when current version misses the mark |

#### **Custom Feedback**
Founders can type specific instructions:
- "Add more details about our target market in NYC"
- "Make this sound less corporate, more startup-like"
- "Connect this to our competitive advantage"
- "Add specific timelines and numbers"

**AI interprets and applies feedback while:**
- Staying true to the founder's original brief responses
- Maintaining consistency with the rest of the framework
- Following section-specific best practices

## 🎬 **User Flow**

### **Step 1: Generation**
1. Founder completes 8-question wizard
2. AI generates Vision Framework (~35 seconds)
3. **Auto-quality scoring runs automatically** (integrated into generation)

### **Step 2: Review**
1. Founder sees all 6 sections with quality badges
2. Low-scoring sections (<6) show "👀 Needs Attention"
3. Founder identifies weak sections at a glance

### **Step 3: Refine**
1. Founder scrolls to weak section (e.g., Near-term Bets: 🔴 5.2/10)
2. Clicks "Quick Actions" → Sees issues/suggestions
3. Clicks "More Specific" (or types custom feedback)
4. AI refines in 10-15 seconds
5. **New quality score appears**: ✨ 8.1/10 Excellent

### **Step 4: Iterate**
1. Founder refines 2-3 more sections
2. All sections now 7.5+ → Framework is high quality
3. Clicks "Save" → Framework persists with refined content
