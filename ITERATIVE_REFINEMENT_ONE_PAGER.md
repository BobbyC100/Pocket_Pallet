## 🌳 **About Banyan**

**Banyan** is an AI-powered strategic operating system for founders and leadership teams. The platform helps founders articulate, align, and operationalize their company's strategic vision through structured frameworks and AI-assisted content generation.

### **Core Product:**
Banyan transforms unstructured founder insights (captured through an 8-question wizard) into three interconnected strategic artifacts:

1. **Vision Framework V2** - A comprehensive strategic blueprint covering:
   - Vision (aspirational end state)
   - Strategy (how we win)
   - Operating Principles (cultural DNA)
   - Near-term Bets (6-12 month commitments)
   - Metrics (what we track)
   - Tensions (strategic trade-offs)

2. **Founder Brief** - A narrative document capturing the founder's thinking, market insights, and strategic context

3. **Executive One-Pager** - An investor-ready summary distilling the vision into a single page

### **The Banyan Philosophy:**
Like the banyan tree that grows deep roots and provides shelter, Banyan helps startups build strong strategic foundations that support sustainable growth. The platform believes strategy should be:
- **Clear** - Not buried in decks or lost in meetings
- **Living** - Evolving as the company learns
- **Aligned** - Shared language across the team
- **Actionable** - Connected to real decisions and bets

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**

Banyan's **Iterative Refinement** system enables founders to improve AI-generated Vision Framework content through intelligent, AI-powered feedback loops. Combined with **Auto-Quality Detection**, founders receive immediate quality assessments and guided improvement suggestions for each section of their framework.

### **Where This Fits in the Product:**
This feature represents Banyan's evolution from a **one-shot generation tool** to a **collaborative co-creation platform**. Rather than founders accepting AI output as-is or manually rewriting elsewhere, they can now refine content iteratively within Banyan—creating a feedback loop where AI learns their voice and founders feel true ownership.

**Product Journey:**
1. **V1 (Launch)**: Wizard → AI Generation → View/Export
2. **V2 (This Feature)**: Wizard → AI Generation → **Quality Assessment** → **Iterative Refinement** → Save/Export
3. **V3 (Future)**: Add team collaboration, version history, and strategic updates as the company evolves

---

## 💡 **The Problem**

**Before this feature:**
- Founders receive AI-generated Vision Framework content but have no way to improve it without manually rewriting
- No visibility into which sections are strong vs. weak
- No guidance on how to make content more specific, actionable, or aligned with their vision
- High friction to iterate: founders must exit Banyan, edit in Google Docs, then re-input changes
- AI-generated content sometimes feels generic or doesn't capture the founder's authentic voice

**Result:** Generic or misaligned content that founders don't feel ownership over, leading to low satisfaction and reduced likelihood of actually using the framework.

---

## ✨ **The Solution**

### **1. Auto-Quality Detection**
Automatically scores each framework section on generation:
- **Specificity** (1-10): Generic vs. Concrete
- **Actionability** (1-10): Vague vs. Clear
- **Alignment** (1-10): Off-brand vs. On-brand
- **Measurability** (1-10): For bets/metrics only

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Excellent (8-10)**: Green badge with score
- 🟡 **Good (6-7.9)**: Yellow badge with score
- 🔴 **Needs Work (<6)**: Red badge + "👀 Needs Attention" flag

**Quality Details:**
- **Issues**: What needs improvement
- **Suggestions**: How to improve
- **Strengths**: What's working well

---

### **2. Iterative Refinement**
Founders can refine any section with one click or custom feedback:

#### **Quick Actions** (Pre-defined refinements)
| Action | What It Does | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **More Specific** | Replaces generic language with concrete details from your brief (markets, numbers, timelines) | Content feels too high-level or vague |
| **More Concise** | Shortens wordy content, removes fluff, makes it punchier | Content is too verbose or redundant |
| **Different Angle** | Reframes the same idea from a new perspective while keeping core meaning | Current framing doesn't resonate |
| **Add Detail** | Expands content with examples, context, and specifics | Content feels incomplete or surface-level |
| **Regenerate** | Complete rewrite from scratch using original brief data | Starting over when current version misses the mark |

#### **Custom Feedback**
Founders can type specific instructions:
- "Add more details about our target market in NYC"
- "Make this sound less corporate, more startup-like"
- "Connect this to our competitive advantage"
- "Add specific timelines and numbers"

**AI interprets and applies feedback while:**
- Staying true to the founder's original brief responses
- Maintaining consistency with the rest of the framework
- Following section-specific best practices

## 🎬 **User Flow**

### **Step 1: Generation**
1. Founder completes 8-question wizard
2. AI generates Vision Framework (~35 seconds)
3. **Auto-quality scoring runs automatically** (integrated into generation)

### **Step 2: Review**
1. Founder sees all 6 sections with quality badges
2. Low-scoring sections (<6) show "👀 Needs Attention"
3. Founder identifies weak sections at a glance

### **Step 3: Refine**
1. Founder scrolls to weak section (e.g., Near-term Bets: 🔴 5.2/10)
2. Clicks "Quick Actions" → Sees issues/suggestions
3. Clicks "More Specific" (or types custom feedback)
4. AI refines in 10-15 seconds
5. **New quality score appears**: ✨ 8.1/10 Excellent

### **Step 4: Iterate**
1. Founder refines 2-3 more sections
2. All sections now 7.5+ → Framework is high quality
3. Clicks "Save" → Framework persists with refined content
