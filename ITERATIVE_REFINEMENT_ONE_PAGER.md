## üå≥ **About Banyan**

**Banyan** is an AI-powered strategic operating system for founders and leadership teams. The platform helps founders articulate, align, and operationalize their company's strategic vision through structured frameworks and AI-assisted content generation.

### **Core Product:**
Banyan transforms unstructured founder insights (captured through an 8-question wizard) into three interconnected strategic artifacts:

1. **Vision Framework V2** - A comprehensive strategic blueprint covering:
   - Vision (aspirational end state)
   - Strategy (how we win)
   - Operating Principles (cultural DNA)
   - Near-term Bets (6-12 month commitments)
   - Metrics (what we track)
   - Tensions (strategic trade-offs)

2. **Founder Brief** - A narrative document capturing the founder's thinking, market insights, and strategic context

3. **Executive One-Pager** - An investor-ready summary distilling the vision into a single page

### **The Banyan Philosophy:**
Like the banyan tree that grows deep roots and provides shelter, Banyan helps startups build strong strategic foundations that support sustainable growth. The platform believes strategy should be:
- **Clear** - Not buried in decks or lost in meetings
- **Living** - Evolving as the company learns
- **Aligned** - Shared language across the team
- **Actionable** - Connected to real decisions and bets

## üéØ **Feature Overview**

Banyan's **Iterative Refinement** system enables founders to improve AI-generated Vision Framework content through intelligent, AI-powered feedback loops. Combined with **Auto-Quality Detection**, founders receive immediate quality assessments and guided improvement suggestions for each section of their framework.

### **Where This Fits in the Product:**
This feature represents Banyan's evolution from a **one-shot generation tool** to a **collaborative co-creation platform**. Rather than founders accepting AI output as-is or manually rewriting elsewhere, they can now refine content iteratively within Banyan‚Äîcreating a feedback loop where AI learns their voice and founders feel true ownership.

**Product Journey:**
1. **V1 (Launch)**: Wizard ‚Üí AI Generation ‚Üí View/Export
2. **V2 (This Feature)**: Wizard ‚Üí AI Generation ‚Üí **Quality Assessment** ‚Üí **Iterative Refinement** ‚Üí Save/Export
3. **V3 (Future)**: Add team collaboration, version history, and strategic updates as the company evolves

---

## üí° **The Problem**

**Before this feature:**
- Founders receive AI-generated Vision Framework content but have no way to improve it without manually rewriting
- No visibility into which sections are strong vs. weak
- No guidance on how to make content more specific, actionable, or aligned with their vision
- High friction to iterate: founders must exit Banyan, edit in Google Docs, then re-input changes
- AI-generated content sometimes feels generic or doesn't capture the founder's authentic voice

**Result:** Generic or misaligned content that founders don't feel ownership over, leading to low satisfaction and reduced likelihood of actually using the framework.

---

## ‚ú® **The Solution**

### **1. Auto-Quality Detection**
Automatically scores each framework section on generation:
- **Specificity** (1-10): Generic vs. Concrete
- **Actionability** (1-10): Vague vs. Clear
- **Alignment** (1-10): Off-brand vs. On-brand ‚≠ê *Most Critical*
- **Measurability** (1-10): For bets/metrics only

**Why Alignment is Weighted Heavily:**
The **Alignment** score compares AI output against the founder's original 8-question wizard responses. A score of 7.5 in Alignment (misaligned with founder's voice) is more concerning than a 5.0 in Specificity (just needs more detail). Alignment builds **trust and ownership**‚Äîthe foundation of this feature.

**Visual Indicators:**
- üü¢ **Excellent (8-10)**: Green badge with score
- üü° **Good (6-7.9)**: Yellow badge with score
- üî¥ **Needs Work (<6)**: Red badge + "üëÄ Needs Attention" flag
- üö® **Low Alignment (<7)**: Special "Voice Misalignment" flag to prioritize founder attention

**Quality Details:**
- **Issues**: What needs improvement
- **Suggestions**: How to improve
- **Strengths**: What's working well

---

### **2. Iterative Refinement**
Founders can refine any section with one click or custom feedback:

#### **Quick Actions** (Pre-defined refinements)
| Action | What It Does | When to Use | Target Speed |
|--------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **More Specific** | Replaces generic language with concrete details from your brief (markets, numbers, timelines) | Content feels too high-level or vague | 8-12 sec |
| **More Concise** | Shortens wordy content, removes fluff, makes it punchier | Content is too verbose or redundant | 8-12 sec |
| **Different Angle** | Reframes the same idea from a new perspective while keeping core meaning | Current framing doesn't resonate | 10-15 sec |
| **Add Detail** | Expands content with examples, context, and specifics | Content feels incomplete or surface-level | 10-15 sec |

#### **Regenerate** (The Nuclear Option - Visually Separated)
| Action | What It Does | When to Use | Target Speed |
|--------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Regenerate** | Complete rewrite from scratch using original brief data | Starting over when current version completely misses the mark | 10-15 sec |

*Note: "Regenerate" is visually/structurally separated in the UI as a secondary, more forceful button to ensure founders use it intentionally, not accidentally.*

#### **Custom Feedback**
Founders can type specific instructions:
- "Add more details about our target market in NYC"
- "Make this sound less corporate, more startup-like"
- "Connect this to our competitive advantage"
- "Add specific timelines and numbers"

**The Refinement Engine is Context-Anchored:**
- Stays true to the founder's original 8-question wizard responses
- Maintains consistency with the rest of the framework
- Follows section-specific best practices
- **Preserves the founder's authentic voice and strategic tenets** ‚Äî even as it rewrites

This means refinements won't just make content "better"‚Äîthey'll make it better **while staying aligned with your vision**.

## üéØ **Strategic Product Insights**

### **What Makes This Feature a Masterstroke:**

1. **Addresses the Inevitable "AI Generics" Problem**
   - Rather than pretending AI output is perfect, we acknowledge it and provide a solution
   - Shifts founder mindset from **"Is this right?"** to **"How do I make this perfectly mine?"**
   - Builds crucial sense of **ownership** through co-creation

2. **Alignment is the Secret Weapon**
   - The **Context-Anchored Refinement Engine** preserves founder's authentic voice
   - Low Alignment scores (<7) are treated more seriously than low Specificity scores
   - Trust-building mechanism: "The AI won't just rewrite‚Äîit will stay true to your vision"

3. **Quality Scoring = Objective Truth**
   - Founders see **5.2/10 Needs Attention** instead of vague "this could be better"
   - Measurable progress: **5.2 ‚Üí 8.1** is tangible improvement
   - Removes guesswork from strategic refinement

4. **Quick Actions Eliminate Prompt Engineering**
   - Founders don't need to be AI experts to get expert results
   - Most common refinement needs (More Specific, More Concise) are one-click
   - Target speed: 8-12 seconds for most actions (optimized for flow state)

5. **Regenerate is the Nuclear Option**
   - Visually/structurally separated to prevent accidental use
   - Forces intentionality: "Are you sure you want to start over?"
   - Other actions are refinements; Regenerate is a restart

### **Why This Elevates Banyan:**

From **"useful tool"** ‚Üí **"must-have strategic partner"**

- **Before:** Founders use Banyan once, export to Google Docs, edit manually
- **After:** Founders iterate within Banyan until framework is perfect
- **Result:** Higher engagement, more sessions per user, stronger product-market fit

### **Key Performance Indicators to Watch:**

| Metric | What It Reveals |
|--------|-----------------|
| % of frameworks using refinement | Feature adoption & product-market fit |
| Avg # of refinements per framework | Depth of engagement & iteration value |
| Time from generation to "Save" | User flow efficiency (target: <10 min) |
| Avg quality score increase per refinement | AI effectiveness (+1.5 target) |
| % sections scoring 8+ after refinement | Output quality consistency (70%+ target) |
| Most-used Quick Action | User pain point insights (hypothesis: "More Specific") |

### **Future-Proofing for V3 (Team Collaboration):**

**Refinement History as Strategic Asset:**
- Store original generation + all refinement versions + quality score progression
- Creates documented audit trail: "Here's how we refined our vision from 5.2 to 8.1"
- Founders can show boards/investors the evolution of their strategic thinking
- Perfect bridge to team collaboration: teammates see the "why" behind changes
