## 🎯 Key Themes

### **Vision Statement**
> "Banyan transforms founder instinct into living strategic clarity."

**The Core Insight:**
Founders have vision in their heads, but it lives in fragments. Banyan externalizes that thinking continuously, not just once.

### **Value Proposition**
- **Speed:** Generate in 10 minutes what takes consultants weeks
- **Living:** Evolves with you, not a static doc
- **Smart:** Learns your voice and patterns
- **Shareable:** Beautiful PDFs, ready to export

### **Market Position**
We're **NOT:**
- A template library (Notion)
- A strategy consultant (expensive, slow)
- A project manager (Asana, Linear)

We **ARE:**
- An AI co-pilot for strategic thinking
- The source of truth for "What are we building?"
- The tool that keeps teams aligned

But broken into achievable phases. Each phase has clear goals and timelines.
