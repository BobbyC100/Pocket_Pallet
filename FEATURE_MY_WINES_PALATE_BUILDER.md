# üç∑ Pocket Pallet Feature Specification ‚Äî "My Wines" & Palate Builder

**Author:** Bobby  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Version:** MVP v1  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview

This feature introduces two connected modules within Pocket Pallet:

1. **My Wines** ‚Üí Centralized dashboard for all user-associated wines
   - Wines appear automatically after CSV or OCR import
   - Users can categorize, rate, and flag wines ("Tried", "Want to Try", "Cellar")

2. **Palate Builder** ‚Üí Guided tasting note and preference-tracking module
   - Helps users learn structured wine vocabulary
   - Records taste profiles used to recommend future wines

**Live at:** `https://pocket-pallet.vercel.app/dashboard`

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Product Goals

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Single Source of Truth** | All imported wines live in one place, synced from both CSV and OCR uploads |
| **Structured Learning** | Users log tastings via standardized "Tasting Notes" |
| **Personalization** | Future recommendation engine can infer user preferences from logged data |
| **Education** | Introduce users to correct wine-tasting vocabulary through guided UI |
| **Consistency** | Tasting notes use fixed categorical fields for predictable analytics |

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ User Flow

### Import ‚Üí My Wines ‚Üí Palate Builder

1. **Upload via CSV or OCR**
   - User uploads file at `/imports/new` or `/ocr`
   - Backend parses and stores new wines in DB
   - User_id automatically associated on save

2. **View My Wines (Dashboard)**
   - List all wines linked to authenticated user
   - Each card shows:
     - Name, region, vintage, price, notes
     - Status badge (Tried, Want to Try, Cellar)
     - Rating (1‚Äì5 stars)

3. **Record Tasting Notes**
   - User clicks "Add Tasting Notes" on wine card
   - Predefined tasting categories appear
   - After submission, tasting data stored in `tasting_notes` table

4. **Build Palate Profile**
   - Aggregates averages per user (e.g., high acidity + medium body + low tannin)
   - Future: recommend wines based on vector similarity between palate + wine profile

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ UI / UX Components

### Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

- Header: "My Wines"
- Quick Actions: Import CSV, Scan OCR, Browse All
- Wine Grid: Displays user's wines with cards

### Wine Card (`app/components/WineCard.tsx`)

```tsx
<Card>
  <h3>{wine.name}</h3>
  <p>{wine.region} ‚Äî {wine.vintage}</p>
  <p>${wine.price_usd}</p>
  <Badge status={wine.status} />  // Tried | Cellar | Want to Try
  <Rating value={wine.rating} />  // 1‚Äì5 stars
  <Button>Add Tasting Notes</Button>
</Card>
```

### Tasting Notes Drawer (`app/components/TastingNotesDrawer.tsx`)

- Appears as a side-drawer/modal form
- Sections: Appearance, Aroma, Palate, Finish
- Fixed vocabulary via dropdowns/sliders to normalize data

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Implementation

### Backend

**Files Created:**
- `app/models/tasting_note.py` - SQLAlchemy model
- `app/schemas/tasting_note.py` - Pydantic schemas
- `app/api/endpoints/tasting_notes.py` - API routes
- `alembic/versions/003_add_tasting_notes_and_wine_ownership.py` - Migration

**Files Modified:**
- `app/models/wine.py` - Added user_id, status, rating
- `app/api/endpoints/wines.py` - Added /my endpoint, status/rating updates
- `app/main.py` - Registered tasting_notes router

### Frontend

**Files Created:**
- `app/types/tasting.ts` - TypeScript types + standardized vocabulary
- `app/components/TastingNotesDrawer.tsx` - Guided note entry form
- `app/components/WineCard.tsx` - Wine card with tasting notes CTA

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/api.ts` - Added `setAuthToken()` helper
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Redesigned for My Wines view

**Dependencies Added:**
- `react-hook-form` - Form state management

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment

### Database Migration

```bash
# On Render, this runs automatically via start command:
alembic upgrade head && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

Migration creates:
- `tasting_notes` table with all fields
- Foreign keys to `wines` and `users`
- Indexes for performance (user_id, wine_id, created_at)
- Wine ownership fields (user_id, status, rating)

### Environment Variables

No new variables needed. Uses existing:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SECRET_KEY`
- `CORS_ORIGINS`
