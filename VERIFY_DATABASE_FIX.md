# ✅ Verify Database Fix

**Quick test to confirm everything works!**

---

## 🧪 Test #1: Check Server Logs (2 minutes)

### Before the fix, you saw:
```
⚠️ Database query failed: PostgresError: relation "vision_embeddings" does not exist
⚠️ Failed to log lens event: PostgresError: relation "lens_events" does not exist
```

### After the fix, you should see:
```
✅ Lens scoring complete: { clarity: 9, alignment: 7, actionability: 9, overall: 8.3 }
✅ Lens event logged successfully
```

---

## 🎬 How to Test

1. **Open your browser:** http://localhost:3002/new

2. **Load test data:** Click "Load Test Data"

3. **Generate brief:** Click "Generate Brief" at the bottom

4. **Watch the terminal logs** - you should NO LONGER see:
   - ❌ `relation "vision_embeddings" does not exist`
   - ❌ `relation "lens_events" does not exist`

5. **Instead, you should see:**
   - ✅ `Lens scoring complete: { ... }`
   - ✅ `[requestId] 💰 Cost: $0.0551 (3377 tokens)` (stored in DB!)

## 🗄️ Test #2: Query the Database (Optional)

Run this to see your cost data:

```bash
node -e "
import('postgres').then(({ default: postgres }) => {
  const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  sql\`SELECT * FROM cost_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5\`
    .then(rows => console.log(JSON.stringify(rows, null, 2)))
    .then(() => sql.end());
});
"
```

You should see rows like:
```json
{
  "id": "req_abc123",
  "operation": "generate-vision-framework-v2",
  "model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
  "total_cost": "0.05841",
  "total_tokens": "3377"
}
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### ✅ Pass = No database errors in terminal logs
### ✅ Pass = Generation completes successfully
### ✅ Pass = Cost tracking logs appear

## 💡 What Changed?

We added these tables to your database:
- `lens_events` - Tracks Founder's Lens analytics
- `vision_embeddings` - Stores vision for alignment scoring
- `lens_reflections` - AI-generated insights
- `cost_events` - Tracks AI operation costs
