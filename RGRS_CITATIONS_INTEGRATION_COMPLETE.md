# 🎉 RGRS Citations Integration Complete!

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Feature:** Research-Backed Citations in Vision Framework Generation  
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR TESTING

---

## ✅ What's Built

### Core Integration
1. **Research Retrieval Step** - New step in generation pipeline
2. **Enhanced Prompts** - AI now receives research context
3. **Citation Metadata** - Citations tracked and returned with framework
4. **Visual Component** - Beautiful research citations display
5. **Automatic Loading** - Citations load from session storage

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Generation Flow

```
User Submits Responses
    ↓
1. Generate Brief (existing)
    ↓
2. **NEW** Retrieve Research Insights  ← RGRS kicks in
    ↓
3. Generate Framework (with research context)
    ↓
4. Validate Framework
    ↓
5. Generate One-Pager
    ↓
6. QA Checks
    ↓
7. Quality Scoring
    ↓
Return Framework + Citations
```

### Research Retrieval

**What happens:**
- Calls `retrieveForGeneration(responses)` with user's inputs
- Searches research corpus using semantic similarity
- Returns top 8 relevant chunks with confidence scores
- Formats research findings for AI prompt
- Passes citations to frontend

**Example retrieval:**
```javascript
researchChunks = await retrieveForGeneration({
  vision_purpose: "Align team goals with company mission",
  vision_endstate: "Every employee understands contribution",
  core_principles: "Transparency, clarity, feedback"
});

// Returns:
// [
//   {
//     chunk: { content: "...", section: "Findings" },
//     similarity: 0.604,
//     boostedScore: 0.604,
//     chunk: { source: { title: "Goal Congruence Study", authors: [...] } }
//   }
// ]
```

### AI Prompt Enhancement

**Before (without RGRS):**
```
Create a vision framework based on these responses:
- Vision: [user input]
- Strategy: [user input]
...
```

**After (with RGRS):**
```
Create a vision framework based on these responses:
- Vision: [user input]
- Strategy: [user input]
...

## Research-Backed Insights

The following findings from organizational science research inform your framework:

**[1] Nurturing Employee Engagement Through Goal Congruence** (Findings)
Our analysis reveals that goal congruence is the strongest predictor of 
employee engagement (β = 0.52, p < 0.001)...

---

When crafting the framework, incorporate insights from the research above 
where relevant. Reference specific findings to add credibility.
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Flow (With Existing Research)

1. **Navigate to `/new`**
2. **Fill in the wizard** (or use "Load Test Data" button)
3. **Submit** and watch generation progress
4. **Observe new step:** "Retrieve Research Insights"
   - Should say "Found 1 relevant research insights" (we ingested Dalain excerpt)
5. **After generation completes:**
   - Navigate to Vision Framework tab
   - **Look at the top** - you should see the Research Citations panel
   - **Check citation details:**
     - Title: "Nurturing Employee Engagement..."
     - Author: "Dalain, M."
     - Section: "## Conclusion"
     - Confidence: ~60% (blue badge)

### Test 2: Without Research (Empty Corpus)

If you clear the database or test with no research ingested:

1. **Follow same steps** as Test 1
2. **Research step will show:** "No research insights found (continuing with standard generation)"
3. **Framework will generate normally** (backwards compatible!)
4. **No citations panel appears** (graceful degradation)

### Test 3: Verify Prompt Enhancement (Check Logs)

1. **Run generation from Test 1**
2. **Check terminal/console logs**
3. **Look for:** `📚 Retrieved 1 research chunks`
4. **AI receives research context** in the prompt (enriched generation)

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No research insights found"

**Possible causes:**
1. Research corpus is empty (no papers ingested)
2. User's vision is very different from ingested research
3. Minimum similarity threshold not met (default 0.6)

**Solution:**
- Ingest more research papers: `npx tsx test-rgrs.ts`
- Lower similarity threshold in `retrieveForGeneration()` (currently 0.6)
- This is normal and expected - system handles it gracefully

### Citations not appearing in UI

**Check:**
1. Is `researchCitations` in session storage metadata?
   - Open DevTools → Application → Session Storage
   - Look for `visionFrameworkV2Draft`
   - Check for `metadata.researchCitations` array
2. Are citations being returned from API?
   - Check Network tab → vision-framework-v2/generate-stream response
   - Look for `researchCitations` in final `complete` event

### Research step fails but generation continues

**This is correct behavior!**
- Research retrieval is wrapped in try/catch
- If it fails, generation continues without research context
- System is backwards-compatible and fault-tolerant

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why retrieve before generation (not after)?
**Answer:** AI generates better content when it has research context upfront. Post-generation citation matching is less accurate.

### Why show citations at the top?
**Answer:** Sets context immediately. Users understand the framework is research-backed from the start.

### Why confidence scores?
**Answer:** Transparency. Users should know how similar their vision is to research findings (not perfect match = expected).

### Why graceful degradation (no research = still works)?
**Answer:** System should work even with empty corpus. Research enhances but doesn't block.

### Why not inline citations in framework text?
**Answer:** Phase 1 focuses on showing research was used. Phase 2 can add [1], [2] tags if users want it.
