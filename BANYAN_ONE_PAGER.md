# 🌳 Banyan — Product One-Pager

## 🎯 Vision

**Banyan transforms founder instinct into living strategic clarity.**

Every founder has a vision in their head — a North Star they're racing toward. But that vision lives in fragments: scattered notes, verbal pitches that change each time, strategic documents that go stale the moment they're written. Founders waste hours translating their thinking for investors, team members, and even themselves.

**This isn't just frustrating—it's measurably harmful.** Research shows that goal misalignment (when organizational and individual goals drift apart) significantly reduces employee engagement, innovation capacity, and organizational performance. Studies demonstrate that strategy-culture alignment creates shared meaning and competitive advantage, while misalignment breeds confusion and underperformance.

**The problem:** Most organizations focus on strategy (the "what") but neglect the translation layer that connects vision to daily behavior (the "how"). As companies scale, this gap widens—vision dilutes, teams drift, and strategic clarity degrades.

**Banyan changes this.** We use AI to help founders externalize their strategic thinking — not just once, but continuously. The result isn't a static document gathering dust in Google Drive. It's a living strategic foundation that evolves with you, keeps your team aligned, and ensures everyone is building toward the same future.

We believe the best companies are built when founders can spend less time explaining themselves and more time executing. Banyan is the AI co-pilot that turns "I know what I mean" into "Everyone knows what we mean."

### Research-Backed Problem

*Studies from organizational psychology confirm what founders feel:*
- **Goal incongruence** reduces engagement and performance (Dalain, 2023)
- **Strategy-culture misalignment** creates confusion and disengagement (Nishii et al., 2016)
- **Missing translation layer** between vision and behavior undermines sustainability (Tosti & Jackson, 2000)

**Banyan provides the translation layer that research shows is missing.**

## 🎓 What We've Learned

### **1. Founders Hate Blank Pages**
Giving someone a "strategic framework template" is like giving them a blank canvas and saying "paint something good." They need AI to scaffold the thinking.

### **2. Quality Feedback Matters**
Users don't just want a document — they want to know if it's *good*. Founder's Lens scoring gives them confidence.

### **3. Export is Table Stakes**
No one wants their strategic doc locked in a web app. PDF export is essential for sharing with investors and team.

### **4. Real-Time Progress Reduces Anxiety**
When generation takes 30+ seconds, users need to see what's happening. Streaming progress makes it feel faster.

### **5. Auto-Save is Non-Negotiable**
Browser crashes are rare, but when they happen, losing work is devastating. Auto-save is a must-have.
